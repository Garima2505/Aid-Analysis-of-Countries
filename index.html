                <p>1. How do the countries compare in terms of how much they receive and
                    donate from other countries? Are there countries that donate much
                    more than they receive or receive much more than they donate?

                     specific geographical areas of the world? Are there neighboring countries
                    that have radically different patterns in terms of how much they receive vs.

                <p>4. How does the amount donated vs. amount received change over time for each
                    country? Are there countries that mostly send or mostly receive and countries
                    that have a similar amount of donations they receive and send? Are there
                    countries that change their role over time? That is, they used to mostly send
                    donations and turn into mostly receiving donations and vice-versa? Are there
                    countries in which you can find a sudden increase ("peak") or a sudden decrease
                    ("valley")?

                    Countries that received aid whereas USA, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom and France are among top
                    Countries that provided the most aid. In year 1992, Poland and Kuwait show sudden increase in the received amount.
                    USA show sudden peak in donating amount in the year 1980, 1981 and 1992.

                <p>5. What are the top 10 purposes of disbursements (in terms of total amount of disbursement)
                    and how does their relative amount compare over time? E.g., are there purposes that tend to
                    be prominent for a period of time and others that become more prominent during other periods?

                    6. Who are the major donors and to which countries do they donate the most and how
                    much? And conversely, who are the major receivers and which countries do they receive
                    from the most and how much? We only care about the top 10 recipients and the top 20 donors
                    over time for this question.

                    7. Considering only the top 5 purposes of donation, how does the relationship between
                    countries look like in terms of purposes? What composition of purposes do the donations
                    between each pair of countries have? Are there countries that donate to a given country
                    using multiple purposes? Or do counties always donate using one single purpose when
                    donating to another country? The same as the previous question, we only care about the
                    top 10 recipients and the top 20 donors here

                    8. For this last exercise you have to extend the analysis above to see how the patterns of
                    donations change over time. Focusing again on the top 8 recipients and top 20 donors how
                    do the patterns of donations (who donates to whom and how much) change over time? Are there
                    sudden changes? Are there countries that always donate to other countries? Are there major
                    shifts (say a country used to donate to a specific set of countries and then it changes to
                    other countries)?
